# Space Arcade
### Basic idea
This main idea of this game is to avoid asteroids or destroy them with your weapon.

### Gameplay
This game is arcade. You can fly endlessly through space. Initially you have 3 lives. You lose your life when got hit by asteroid. Game is over when all 3 lives are over.

#### Some features
1. Each asteroid destroyed by laser shot gives you 50 points.
2. If you avoid asteroid and it goes away from your spaceship, your score decreases by 1 point.
3. Field is splitted in 2 identical areas vertically. Use left side as a virtual joystick to move your ship and tap right side to fire.
4. We have some sound and music in our game :)
5. Also we have tried to reach 60 fps (and seems that we coped with it)
